### Getting Started with Create React App

~~This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).~~
And I regret it, dont be like me and use nextjs.

## Cloning the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/matrSid/pyplayground.git
cd pyplayground
```

# Building
```

yarn install
yarn start
```
## Explore.
And thats it ! you can now go to http://localhost:3000 to see and tweak it for yourself.
